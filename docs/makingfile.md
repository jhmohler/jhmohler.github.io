# Create an album rankings data file

This task will require a .csv file editor such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to complete.

1. Open a blank sheet in your preferred .csv file editor.
2. In the first row of the sheet, fill out the first 8 cells with the words **‘Year’**, **‘Ranking’**, **‘Album’**, **‘Artist’**, **‘Rating’**, **‘Vinyl’**, **‘EP’**, and **‘Live’**.

3. Underneath the **‘Year**’ cell in column A, enter the release years for each album you want to rank in ascending order. Certain features of My Favorite Albums will only support albums between the years 1993 and 2024\.
