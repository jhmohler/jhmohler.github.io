# FAQ

## Using a My Favorite Albums Page

**Question:** While using ‘Band Comparison’, why does no line appear for some bands?

Colored lines connect a band or artist’s albums together on the line chart, so if that band or artist only has one album rated, it will instead just appear as a black point on its release date and rating.

**Question:** Why do the search bars in ‘Bands and Artists’, ‘Top Albums by Year’, and ‘Band Comparison’ sometimes not let me enter text?

If the search bar has already been filled with text, it cannot be modified until you press backspace to delete the input.

## Creating a My Favorite Albums Page

**Question:** How do I install R and RStudio to create my own My Favorite Albums page?

A list of all mirrors for R installation can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). The official download page for RStudio can be found [here](https://posit.co/downloads/).

**Question:** How do I format the albums data sheet if I have a live album on vinyl?

Mark the ‘Vinyl’ cell with ‘v’, and also the ‘Live’ cell with ‘Live’.

**Question:** Do albums have to be listed in ascending order by release year in the album-ranking.csv file?

No. The instructions on creating the album-ranking.csv file only do so in order to make ranking albums within each year easier.

**Question:** What functions do not support albums outside of the 1993 \- 2024 year range?

‘Number One Albums’ and ‘Band Comparison’. The year selection bar in ‘Number One Albums’ only allows for selection between 1993 and 2024, and the line chart in ‘Band Comparison’ loses its formatting when albums outside of that year range are plotted.
